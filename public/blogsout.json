      "notes": "Dear Rasikas,<br/><br/>We are glad to present this week's update.<br/><br/>Inline Player<br/>Based on a rasika request, we have added support for inline playing of all&nbsp; audio content on our site. Now you can hear audio clips on the webpage itself. If you prefer, you can still download the files to your computer - please right-click and save.&nbsp; Please let us know if you face any issues.<br/><br/>Higher quality MP3 audio files<br/>One of our esteemed visitor informed us that the audio quality of last week's update on twin raga differentiation of Purvikalyani and Pantuvarali was not good. We thank them for their feedback. We have again uploaded the same audio files, but with a higher bitrate (64kbps) which should sound much better than the previous one. However, the file sizes have grown bigger which will result in longer download times. We plan to stick to the new scheme unless there are any download issues encountered. Please do not hesitate to notify us in case you face any issues&nbsp; while listening to these files.<br/><br/>Quiz<br/>We thank all rasikas who participate in our quiz regularly. A tip for those who may not be aware: All ragas asked in the Quiz are covered in the Identifying Ragas section.<br/><br/>Our last week's Quiz had a special question based on Twin Raga Identification (Pantuvarali and Purvikalyani). We are delighted to know that all rasikas (except one) have identified the correct answer.<br/><br/>This clearly proves that rasikas have listened and found the update useful..just joking :-). Actually, we have no way of knowing this.&nbsp; But, we do&nbsp; hope you found this useful and enjoyable. Please do share your feedback with us - we are eager to hear from you!<br/><br/>Raga Update (Sama - Cine)<br/>We had received a rasika request&nbsp; to provide a new cine piece (K. Balachander's movie Nool Veli) for Sama Ragam. We are happy to be able honour this request and we have updated our Identifying Ragas page with this. You can also access it directly here: Sama Cine 2<br/><br/>Week 28 Update:<br/><ul><li>New Raga added: Desh</li><li>Raga Update: Sama - Cine</li><li>Twin Raga differentiation: Pantuvarali and Purvikalyani (better quality mp3 updated)<br/></li><li>Week 28 Quiz</li><li>Full song added: Pachai mamalai pol meni</li></ul>The full song for this week, 'Pachai mamalai pol meni' is a famous Pasuram of Thondaradipodi Azhwar, in praise of Lord Sri Ranganatha of Sri Rangam.&nbsp; The composer describing the beauty of the Lord says he would only prefer to stay at Srirangam and sing the praises of the Lord even if he were offered an opportunity to rule the Indira Loka.<br/><br/>We are aware that so many of our esteemed rasikas are, indeed, very knowledgeable in Carnatic music and yet they continue to visit our site regularly, respond to our weekly quizzes and give us encouraging feedback. A BIG Thank you to all of you!<br/><br/>Thanks for reading and have a great week ahead!<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Team<br/><br/>"

This time we thought why not attempt a bilingual :) \n<br/><br/>\nDo you dream of a poverty free, corruption free, terrorism free India?  Do you think India will prosper to attain the status of a developed nation? Just like Mahakavi Bharathiyar dreamt of an 'Independent India' much before India got its freedom, this bilingual composition, (Tamil lyrics and tune by Uma, Hindi lyrics by Manish Kumar Gupta and tune by Uma) captures our dream of a prosperous and peaceful India.\n<br/><br/>\nWe hope you will enjoy both the Tamil and Hindi versions of this Brindavani song!\n<br/><br/>\nKeep your quiz answers coming and hoping to surprise you with something special next week! Stay tuned!\n<br/><br/>\nRaga Surabhi Team."

      "notes": "Dear Rasikas,<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi celebrates the completion of five years today!  As we look back, we really cannot believe that it has been such five short years! Our sincere thanks to all our rasikas world-wide who have joined us in this amazing musical journey and have been the motivation for us to keep moving on! THANK YOU ALL!<br/><br/>What is special this birthday?? Well, we have quite a few new things to share and will be happy if you can read through the entire blog patiently :)<br/><br/><b>Carnatic Fusion</b>:<br/><br/>\"<em>Is there any confusion? Nah, it's just fusion</em>\" - We are so very very thrilled to embark on our first ever Carnatic fusion adventure with the amazingly talented Vijay Kannan. This Fusion, titled 'Madhava Maya', is based on a Papanasam Sivan composition in the raga Hamsanandi. <br/><br/>Please listen to it on Vijay Kannan's Sound Cloud channel here: <br/><br/><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/165463536&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=false\"></iframe><br/><br/>(Use of headphones highly recommended). <br/><br/>We also highly recommend checking out his other works in <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/indian_music_fan\" >Vijay Kannan's SoundCloud Channel</a>. We are sure you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/><b>Varnam Lessons</b>:<br/><br/>Based on popular demand, we are happy to announce to launch paid varnam Lessons on Raga Surabhi. We hope that these lessons will be useful to carnatic music students.<br/><br/>Please check this page: <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"/carnatic-music/buy-varnam-lessons.html\">Varnam Lessons (Buy)</a><br/><br/><br/>Why Paid? <br/><br/>We thought launching a commercial initiative by offering varnam lessons to rasikas will help generate revenue for sustaining Raga Surabhi for its infrastructure and technology needs.. We are sure our rasikas who have come with us in this journey would appreciate the amount of effort and investment that has gone into building Raga Surabhi.<br/><br/><b>Youtube channel</b>:<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi is now officially on YouTube: ( <a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ragasurabhi\">http://www.youtube.com/ragasurabhi</a> ) ! We have uploaded all our Ragas in YouTube and we plan to upload songs and other content in near future. We request our rasikas to subscribe to our YouTube channel and make use of it:<br/><script src=\"https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js\"></script><br/><div class=\"g-ytsubscribe\" data-channelid=\"UC1CMhcUFJ25ybiVMWQSvqVg\" data-layout=\"full\" data-count=\"hidden\"></div><br/><br/><b>Raga for Relaxation</b>:<br/><br/>We are happy to launch a segment called 'Raga for Relaxation' (only available on youtube). The first video is based on Raga Bowli <br/><br/><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/yEOoUZo0bPE?list=UU1CMhcUFJ25ybiVMWQSvqVg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/>This is also a new experiment for us and as the name says, it is music for relaxation. Just sit back and enjoy. We hope that this kind of relaxation music will appeal to a broad section of music lovers. We would really appreciate if you can let us know your feedback on this segment. We are eagerly waiting!<br/><br/><b>One more thing: Special Ragamalika Quiz</b>:<br/><br/>In the best traditions of Raga Surabhi, we present to you a special ragamalika quiz along with the regular quiz. It is bit tricky, but we are sure that you will find it interesting! Looking forward to your answers before next weekend.<br/><br/>Have a great week ahead!<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Team<br/><br/>"

      "notes": "\"A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step\"<br/><br/>So it is with this little experiment that we started exactly one year ago called Raga Surabhi. Yes, it is a special moment for us, as Raga Surabhi turns one - it is a moment to reflect and look back with happiness, satisfaction and indeed pride. Around the same time last year, Raga Surabhi had a small collection of 10 ragas and today, as we complete one year, we are thrilled to see the count touch the magical figure of 100!<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi stands testimony to the fact that something special, is indeed possible, as we cope with the demands of the daily grind that is life. We cherish all that is part of Raga Surabhi - the Weekly Raga Quiz, Surabhi Post, Identifying Ragas and Raga Comparisons. But, above all that, what we cherish the most about Raga Surabhi is You! - the many rasikas, who have encouraged us all along to fare forward, week after week. To get mails from new visitors who stumble upon our website is really a thrill and that alone acts as a tonic and keep us going! A mail we got recently from a new visitor sums up both the goal and the tiny accomplishment of Raga Surabhi:<br/><br/>\"Hello Hats off to you people... one understands the value of internet when we get to see these sites. I get the feeling that even I can learn ragas...\"<br/><br/>Now, that we have crossed the 100 raga milestone, we feel it is time to switch gears. We plan to go slow on adding new ragas as the 100 covered so far is sizable and forms a good set for carnatic music appreciation. We hope to continue the other segments as usual, especially the Weekly Raga Quiz. Do continue to participate in the Weekly Quiz contests and keep your feedback coming to us. We really like that. Also, an important task we plan to undertake in lieu of adding new ragas is updating the existing ragas with new audio clips. As some of you may be aware, we recently upgraded our audio recording equipment and the sound quality with the new arrangement is much better. We hope to rerecord all of the old audio content with the new equipment in the course of the next several weeks.<br/><br/>And, last but not the least, we would like to thank Mr. Shafeek from Chennai (colleague of Ramasubramaniam) and Ramu Adapala (colleague of Sriram) from Bangalore, who helped us put up the special visual effects on the website to celebrate the occasion of Raga Surabhi's first anniversary. Hope you like the beautiful stars and balloons as well as the popup window. (Alright, yes, the popup will be removed after some time :)<br/><br/>Week 53 Update:<br/>New Ragas added: Kurinji, Nadanamakriya, Punnagavarali, Shenjurutti, Yamuna Kalyani. The new raga segment for this week features five ragas that are commonly sung in the madhyama shruti.<br/>Surabhi Post 11 -  (A must read before listening to new ragas of this week). Talks about the meaning of madhyama shruti and how it differs from the normal panchama shruti<br/>Weekly Quiz 53 and DIY exercises - We have a special question in our weekly quiz apart from the regular three questions.   Its quite some time since we introduced the DIY exercises, so we thought it would now be appropriate to move on to akaram exercises along with swaras.  Hope rasikas like the idea and find it useful.<br/>Testimonials updated<br/>Golden Jubilee Raga Crossword Results and discussion on Weekly Quiz page<br/>Full song added: Raga Rathna Malikache<br/><br/>Full song for the week<br/>\"Raga Ratna Malikache Ranjillu Nata Shri Hari Sata\" in Reeti Gowlai set to Adi tala believed to be Saint Thyagaraja's hundredth composition. In the pallavi, Thyagaraja says \"Lord Hari is immensely pleased with my offering of the garland made of hundred melodious ragas\".<br/><br/>Is it not an apt number for this week when Raga Surabhi also completes a garland of hundred melodious ragas?<br/><br/>Thank you again rasikas, and you have a great week!<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Team<br/><br/>"

This week, we have two compositions in memory of the great man.<br/>First one is a tamil song, penned by Dr. S. Vasudevan and tuned by Uma in raga Hamsanadam and Sree ragam. (Sree Ragam was Dr. Kalam's favorite raga)<br/>The next one is hindi composition, adapted from a poem written by Manish Kumar Gupta as a tribute to Dr. Kalam, again tuned by Uma in raga Hameer Kalyani<br/><br/>We found the verses of both the above songs very touching. Dr. Vasudevan's tamil poem traces the life of Kalam from his humble origins in Rameshwaram to becoming the President of India. Manish's soaring poem is an exhortation to one and all to fly on the \"<a class=\"body_bulklinktext\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_of_Fire\">Wings of Fire</a>\" and fulfil Dr. Kalam's dream and vision of a strong and prosperous India by 2020.<br/><br/>Manish blogs at <a class=\"body_bulklinktext\" href=\"http://manishkg.tumblr.com\">http://manishkg.tumblr.com/</a>.

This has been entirely possible because of the constant support and motivation from our rasikas across the globe. &nbsp;Unlike the customary special quizzes, we have something entirely different.&nbsp;<br/><br/>We are much delighted to launch a new segment, named Laya Lahari, to help rasikas understand and appreciate the various aspects of laya in carnatic music. &nbsp;We propose to do it by way of lecture-demonstrations along with short write ups where necessary. The idea of Laya Lahiri was triggered by several rasikas writing and asking us to cover laya aspects. We have not come across similar initiatives on the Internet and hope that rasikas find it useful.<br/><br/>We would like to thank Mridangam Vidwan, Thillaisthanam Shri. R. Suriyanarayanan, who is literally the voice behind Laya Lahiri.<br/>When we approached Shri Suri with the request of working with us for 'Laya Lahari', he immediately liked the idea and enthusiastically accepted to perform the lecuture-demonstrations for us. &nbsp;Being a senior vidwan and a busy performer round the year, it is indeed a special privilege for Raga Surabhi to feature him in this exclusive segment. &nbsp;We, once again, thank him for his time and for supporting and joining us in this exciting journey into the world of carnatic music.<br/><br/>We hope you will enjoy his lucid tamil explanations as much as his demonstrations. We eagerly look forward to your feedback on our new segment, do let us know!<br/><br/>On a completely different note, we have to share a 'not so good' news with you. &nbsp;In the recent past, our regular followers would have noticed that there have been several weeks with lean updates with occasional raga comparisons and full songs. &nbsp;The reason for this is Uma has been having problems with her throat for the last two months that have been diagnosed as more serious than a weather induced sore throat. As per medical opinion, this will take at least a few months to recover. Uma will try her best to keep the updates going with whatever she can and whenever she feels comfortable would do more raga episodes or full songs. &nbsp;With the best wishes of all Raga Surabhi rasikas, we are confident Uma would recover much sooner.<br/><br/>Thanks again and do continue to participate in the quizzes.<br/><br/>"

The focus of the column is to discuss fundamental aspects of Carnatic Music and to enlighten the general rasikas by keeping the discourse simple and easy-to-understandAs you are aware, we now have a reasonably good collection of important ragas in our Identifying Ragas section. While we will continue to add more ragas, we felt that it is important to gain a deeper understanding of the ragas covered so far. For instance, there are many ragas which are similar and difficult to distinguish from each other, for example, Bharavi and Mukhari, Anada Bhairavi and Reethi Gowlai, Poorvi Kalyani and Pantuvarali&nbsp; and so on. Through Surabhi Post, we will dive deeper to address these and other subjects of interest. The format will be combination of both written text and audio content, as some points are best explained by examples and demostrations. As our guiding prinicple, this column will strive to simplify, without over-simplifying and explain grammar and technicalities in simple terms.We hope you will find this column interesting. As always, we look forward to your feedback, participation and support.Week 21 Update:&nbsp;New Raga added: Mukhari&nbsp;Weekly Quiz 21&nbsp;Full song: Bantureethi Kolu, a popular Thyagaraja krithi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this composition Thyagaraja pleads to Lord Rama to give the opportunity to be His servant and perform seva to Him.<br/><br/>"

Hope you find it useful and enjoyable. &nbsp;<br/><br/>We share the concert reviews sent to us by two of our new rasikas, Mr.Gopal Srinivasan and Ms.Sumathi Suresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;We thank them for taking time out to write to us. &nbsp;Hope you will enjoy reading them. &nbsp;<br/><br/><br/>Gopal's Musings at the Music Academy:<br/>Kanyakumari and Embar Kannan - Violin ( 16-12-2010 ) :<br/><br/>The Thyagaraja Kriti \" Kalikiyunde \" was performed nicely as both Kanyakumari&nbsp;and Kannan blended well with swara exchanges .The song Bogeenthra Sayeenam in&nbsp;Kuntalavarali followed by RTP in the raga Charukesi were the&nbsp;other highlights. Mannargudi Easwaran ( mridangam ) and Bangalore Amrit on the&nbsp;ganjira supported by Bhagyalakshmi on the Moharsing were appealing to the ears.&nbsp;It&nbsp;was encouraging to see Mannargudi Easwaran guiding the young&nbsp;artist plying Moharsing at every step.<br/><br/>Gayathri Venkataraghavan ( 17-12-2010 ) &nbsp;:<br/><br/>It was a brilliant Thodi raga alapana combined with the intelligent selection of<br/>Shyama&nbsp;Sastri kriti \" Ninne Namminanu \" as the main song which elevated the quality of&nbsp;her concert . Besides Brindavana saranga of Rangapuravihara was neatly executed.&nbsp;She took up the RTP in Arabhi after both Ganapthiraman ( Mridangam ) and Uma&nbsp;shankar ( Ghatam ) vied with each other to catch the attention of the audience&nbsp;with a result she was running out of time. But within the time available shemanged to do her best.<br/><br/>T. N Seshagopalan ( 19-12 -2010 ) &nbsp;:<br/><br/>It was expected that TNS would put up the best performance at The Academy and&nbsp;he did expose some of his brilliance though his voice was non cooperative at&nbsp;times.&nbsp;His Meru samana in Mayamalavagowla was excellently rendered. The vilonist Delhi&nbsp;Suderrajan and Vellore Ramabadran on the mirdangam gave adequate support.<br/><br/>Ranjani Gayathri &nbsp;( 25 -12-2010) :<br/><br/>R and G 's ability to keep the listeners under rapture was in evidence<br/>throughout&nbsp;the concert . The RTP in the raga Dwajavanthi was marvellous followed by&nbsp;selected&nbsp;raga variations . The abang was a classic rendition. Charumathi raghuraman was&nbsp;at her best during the concert with a good violin performance.<br/><br/>Dr Jayanthi Kumaresh ( 27-12-2010 ) :<br/><br/>It was &nbsp;very pleasant to hear the veena recital of Jayanthi Kumaresh . The audio&nbsp;system in the academy probably enhanced the quality of the music. &nbsp;The raga&nbsp;begada&nbsp;was melodious and nicely rendered.<br/><br/>Vijayalakshmi Subramanian (30-12-2010 ) :<br/><br/>It was a &nbsp;brisk performance by Vijayalakshmi with Nannupalimba followed by Amba&nbsp;Neelambari after the raga alapana in Poorvi kalyani . Her RTP in bairavi was&nbsp;excellent.<br/>She dedicated her performance to her guru Mr Rajam .<br/><br/>Abishek Raghuram (30-12-2010 ) :<br/><br/>Considering his age and experience , it was a sheer delight to hear Abishek<br/>performing&nbsp;so well in the ragas both Nattai and Madhyamavathi . The raga Thodi was&nbsp;elaborately&nbsp;taken up with the audience supporting and enjoying his music thoroughly.The&nbsp;viloinist&nbsp;Mysore Srikanth was an able support to Abhishek as he could reproduce exactly&nbsp;the&nbsp;same sangathis of Abishek.<br/><br/>I missed the performance of Nitya shree and Sudha . As for Sanjay, Bombay<br/>Jeyashree&nbsp;and Aruna Sairam their performance were beyond words and description as they are&nbsp;truly the music maestros proved time and again.<br/><br/>Sowmya's Sugamana Ragangal by Sumathi Suresh<br/>Smt Sowmya on 21/12/10 at the Music Academy:<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Smt Sowmya was accompanied by Dr M Narmadha on the violin, J Vaidyanathan on the Mridangam&nbsp;and B Sundarakumar on the kanjira.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Sowmya started the kutcheri with Chalamela Varnam in Nattaikurinji, followed by&nbsp;Janaki Ramana in Suddha Seemandhini. Then came the pleasing Kalyani, a Tyagaraja kriti&nbsp;Amma ravamma with neraval at Tamarasa Dala netri. Very neat presentation.<br/>Next she presented Kaana Vendamo in Sriranjini, with much devotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>Vara Naradamuni in Vijayashri was sung in between and the Raga Saveri was takenfor alapana.&nbsp; Then the Arunachala Kavirayar's Rama natakam song Yaro Ivar Yaro was &nbsp;sung in Saveri, while we are accustomed to its Bhairavi version only.&nbsp; Later, I was told&nbsp;that originally it was sung in Saveri only. &nbsp;The RTP in Saramati was&nbsp;scholarly and the pallavi&nbsp;vandE vEda&nbsp;sAram ati&nbsp;sundarAkAram shivam&nbsp; was good.<br/>The kutcheri came to an end with a Khamas javali and a Bharathiyar song villinaiyotha&nbsp;puruvam.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Have a great week and a great year!<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Team.<br/><br/>"

Doesn't it sound really great?<br/><br/>We are sure all our rasikas are equally thrilled and excited as we are and what a fantastic musical journey it has been all these 200 continuous weeks!  Raga Surabhi thanks each one of you on this special occasion, for this has been entirely possible because of your support, encouragement and motivation and we continue to look forward to all of it going forward!<br/><br/>This week we are glad to take up a long pending rasika request, one of the famous Thevaram hymns, 'Kolaru Thiruppathigam' of Thirugnana Sambandar.  It is believed that regular chanting or even listening to these padigams helps  one overcome the evil effects of planetary motion.  The most popular version of this hymn is by Seerkazhi Govindarajan in raga Shankarabaranam.  One might have occasionally heard the first padigam 'Veyuru tholipangan' as a viruttam in Carnatic concerts.  Uma has sung the 11 padhigams in a Ragamalika format, choosing ragas of her own choice.  We hope you will find it enjoyable, would be nice if you can share your feedback on this.<br/><br/>Yes... we are coming to it next...

It's been a special journey for us in the last four years where we have been able to connect with so many rasikas through the medium of Raga Surabhi. To celebrate this occasion, we have a week long 'Raga Surabhi Theme Music Fest' starting today. The next seven days, from Sunday, Aug 25, 2013 till Saturday, Aug 31, 2013, will feature a new Raga Surabhi theme music clip. We have tried to capture the moods of different ragas in the various clips. Do check back every day for a new clip next week. We enjoyed making these little compositions, we hope you will too enjoy listening to them! Do drop us a line on what you think about these clips and which was your favorite theme. We are eager to hear from you!  Also, if you have a personal favorite raga that you think will suit well with Raga Surabhi theme music, let us know. If possible, we'll try to honor that request.<br/><br/>In this week's weekly update, we are happy to take up one of the lilting Annamacharya compositions, 'Muddugare Yashoda' in raga Kurinji this week.

Thank you rasikas!<br/><br/>This week's update features our usual Weekly Quiz and Do It Yourself exercises.<br/><br/>Plus, there is a Surabhi Post blog entry titled \"Surabhi Post - 12 Raga Surabhi - The journey so far and future directions\" from Uma:<br/><br/>\"With the completion of one year since the launch of Raga Surabhi, it is time to reflect and introspect on our journey so far. The sole idea of setting up Raga Surabhi was to create more awareness about carnatic music in relatively new beginners and enhance concert listening experience by making the raga identification process simple...<br/><br/>...I would like to mention here that the 100 ragas covered so far is a fairly good mix of all types of ragas.&nbsp; We have handled ghana ragas like thodi, shankarabaranam... ragas with special emotive appeal like saramati, sahana, kalyanavasantham, kanada...<br/><br/>...The concept of signature is made possible by the unique sancharas which are characteristic and specific to a particular raga.&nbsp; In the case of ragas with similar swaras, signature alone would not be sufficient\" (more...)<br/><br/>Thank you again<br/><br/>Have a great week ahead<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Team<br/><br/>"

The concert was under the auspices of IAHV (international association for human values), a fund raiser for under privileged children in India. The event attended by Dutch and Indians was a great success and well received.<br/><br/>There are two songs in this week's update - recorded live from the concert. One is a piece to reflect the raga system of Carnatic Music and another a Dutch composition, lyrics and music both composed by Uma (based on the theme of IAHV). The dutch lyrics and the english translation of the song is given below:<br/><br/>Original Song:<br/>Liefde, vrede,<br/>Geluk en vriendelijkheid<br/>Is de aard van<br/>Alle mensen<br/><br/>Laten we ons<br/>leven mooi maken<br/>Door voor elkaar<br/>te zorgen<br/>en met elkaar<br/>te delen<br/><br/>English translation:<br/><br/>Love, peace<br/>Happiness and kindness<br/>Is the nature of<br/>All human beings<br/><br/>Lets make our<br/>lives beautiful<br/>By caring for each other<br/>And sharing with each other.<br/><br/><br/>That's it for this week's update..

This week is special because with this week's update we have reached a twin milestone of 20 weeks and 50 ragas!Yes, this is the 20th week since the launch of Raga Surabhi and and it is indeed a special and proud moment for the entire team. When we embarked on this journey of fathoming the world of carnatic music, to be frank with you, we were quite skeptical. Our doubts were on several counts - whether Raga Surabhi would reach those people for whom the site was created, whether the signature tunes (a unique concept introduced for the first time by us) would find acceptance with the rasikas, whether the rasikas would find the signature tunes helping them out with raga identification and lastly whether people would respond back to us with their feedback amidst the din and bustle of day to day life!&nbsp; But, your comments and mails proved us wrong and&nbsp;all our skepticism faded away within the first few weeks of the launch of the site! All the encouraging and motivating feedback from your end kept us going and has brought us this far.&nbsp; Really, each one of your comments, feedback mails and quiz answers is precious and important to us and they get the entire credit for making Raga Surabhi go steadily through all these weeks. A BIG THANK YOU to all of you!!!Though there are hundreds of ragas, the 50 ragas so far covered are the important ones that find place in any concert platform. &nbsp;In fact, this year's music fest saw atleast 60 - 70% of these ragas feature in the concerts of both the leading and upcoming artists. &nbsp;So, if one is thorough with these 50, they can consider themselves sufficiently carnatic literate!And as always, please do not forget to mail us your feedback and quiz answers! Please spread the word about Raga Surabhi to your friends, relatives and carnatic music students. &nbsp;More the rasikas, more the rasa........&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a few special updates and important announcements&nbsp; for this week:- Raga Surabhi Theme Music: Yes, we like to celebrate a bit now that we have completed 20 weeks :-). And, well, we thought, how about a theme music for this site. After all, what is a carnatic music website without theme music of its own. So, we are very happy to announce the launch of The Raga Surabhi Theme Music. Please do listen to it and download to your mobile phones and set as ringtones (Nokia AMR ringtone format). This theme music is composed by Uma and supported by Ramasubramaniam and Master Siddharth S Ramalingam (on Keyboard). This is the first time Siddharth has played for Raga Surabhi and we hope that there are many more to come&nbsp;- Full Song: A very special song in the Full Songs category: This song is&nbsp; Kalaiyo Peridhu.&nbsp; This song was composed by Uma's Guru, Smt. Lalitha Sivakumar, as an invocation piece for a conference on higher education, held in Chennai, a couple of months earlier.&nbsp; Though a short one, the song is rich in both its lyrical and musical content and brings forth the importance of education in one's life.- Weekly Quiz: As usual we have three questions, but instead of the cine song the question would feature only swara patterns of a particular raga from which one has to identify the raga.&nbsp; This would hopefully make the quiz more interesting and also taje the rasikas to a higher level of awareness!&nbsp; - Raga Surabhi on You Tube:We have made available select Raga Surabhi compositions on You Tube. Please do check them out here and subscribe to ragasurabhi channel on YouTube here:http://www.youtube.com/ragasurabhiWeek 20 Update:- Two ragas (regular update) &nbsp;Neelambari and Subha Pantuvarali and Two ragas (special update for week 20) Suddha Saveri and Vachaspathi. - Raga Surabhi Theme Music- Weekly Quiz- Full Song<br/><br/>"

In an effort to address the feedback provided by our rasikas over time and the technical limitations in the current platform(weebly), we had decided to move to a new web hosting provider. Some of the enhancements that we would like to bring in are also a reason for this change.  We would like to thank Weebly which has been a great support for us to get this far.<br/><br/>Sriram Varadarajan (who drives the tech side of Raga Surabhi) has made this migration possible.  It was quite an effort to migrate more than 1600 files and assets  (unbelievable!) put in place over the last three years from weebly to the new platform.<br/><br/>The URL for the new site is new.ragasurabhi.com.  We will do a parallel run for the next few weeks and eventually move to the new site.  That said, what does this mean for all of us?<br/><br/>Ragas organized in an alphabetical order for ease of use<br/>Separate page for each raga<br/>Raga comparisons handled in separate page<br/>Quizzes organized week wise and can be launched in separate page<br/>For Raga Surabhi team, this migration helps in automating the weekly updates :)<br/><br/>Hopefully, all these changes have considerably improved the site's performance and user experience :)  However, as always, we would like to receive feedback from our esteemed rasikas.  This is a beta launch only.  We look forward to your support in testing and providing us any feedback and suggestions regarding the new site.  There are some more features in the pipeline that we are working on - like display of swaras in Arohanam and Avarohanam for each raga (scale), facebook and twitter integration, message board.... and so on...<br/><br/>With all the migration stuff going on, we have just the quiz and DIY exercises in this week' update.   Some of the rasikas feel that the special quiz this time was little more challenging.  So here are a few clues :) - all clips contain 10 ragas.  Ragamalika and Swaramalika clips are based on twin ragas.

This song is available on our site, Youtube and Soundcloud for your listening pleasure (All links right below the post). Uma has tuned the names of all the 72 ragas in a Ragamalika song format.

It is indeed an honor to have at least met some of your expectations. Some excerpts of your comments are:<br/><br/>\"As a carnatic music listener this is what I've been wishing for - how to learn to recognise ragas?? I really love the representation of each raga in carnatic and cine forms. For me the 'icing on the cake' is the clear rendering of the signature of each raga. It sticks to your mind and helps in identifying a raga whenever heard!!<br/><br/>Using the arohanam/avarohanam, I've tried to play the notes of a few ragas on my keyboard and have started to appreciate them. When I listened to 'Karpagame' I was able identify the raga 'Madhyamavati'. I would'nt have been able to do this a few weeks ago. Your excellent efforts are definitely worthwhile and is being put to good use.\"<br/>- Vijayanand Narayanan, London<br/><br/>\"Very nice to visit such a nice and informative web site.  Once again, my pranams to who are all working behind the website.  Wonderful information about Carnatic music.\"<br/>- Balaji, Abu Dhabi<br/><br/>\"We get to know the Raaga of both carnatic and cine songs which is a very good feature of this site.\"<br/>- Sangeeta Chandrasekar<br/><br/>\"The signature aspect of the ragas, immediate samples and cine songs are key aspects of this site\"<br/>- Vijayakumar Ganapathy Sankaran<br/><br/>Thanks for all your wishes.<br/><br/>Coming to our weekly update we have as usual:<br/><br/>- Hamsanandhi and Lalitha added<br/>- Dikshitar's kriti on Godess Meenakshi is the full song of the week<br/>This is a composition of Sri Muthuswamy Dikshithar in the ragam Gamakakriya (Purvi Kalyani).  Dikshithar composed this krithi in the praise of Goddess Meenakshi, the presiding deity at Madurai, during his visit to Madurai.  This is supposedly is his last composition.  Dikshithar captures the beauty of Goddess Meenakshi in his indomitable style.<br/>- Weekly quiz and the winners for last week<br/><br/>Suggestions/comments - please do write to us or blog your thoughts.<br/>Happy listening and have a great week ahead!<br/><br/>"

We have extended the deadline by another week to enable more rasikas participate in the quiz after a few of them wrote to us asking if we could give them some extra time. The new deadline is 12th July 2013.  Just in case, you are one of those, who did not find time to do the quiz before, please do it right away! And for those rasikas, who were expecting the results this week, sorry about that! But, the results are just one more week away!<br/><br/>Moving on to this week's update, we have Ambujam Krishna's lilting Reethigowlai melody, 'Guruvayoorappane Appan' for you this week.  Please sit back and enjoy!<br/><br/>Many of you might have noticed already, we have changed the web audio player on our website. We had used the Yahoo! Web player for so long, but that was <a href=\"http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/54125001066/keeping-our-focus-on-whats-next\" >retired on June 30, 2013</a>. We were happy to find a suitable replacement audio player in <a href=\"http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/\" >SoundManager2</a>. Please let us know if you find any issues listening to our audio content using the new player.<br/><br/>We will be back with the results of the special quiz in our next update!

Hope you will find them useful. &nbsp;<br/><br/>We also present the Bhairavi-Mukhari comparison ( a large number of rasika requests for this pair) in our 'Twin Raga' segment.&nbsp;In the comparison segment, we have discussed the key sancharas for identification of Mukhari. &nbsp;Mukhari can also be identified through other subtle nuances. However, in order not to confuse rasikas &nbsp; &nbsp; with too many, we have deliberately kept it simple! &nbsp;As always, we look forward to your feedback on this and let us know if this has been useful<br/><br/>The full song for the week is also a rasika request, Arulavendum Thaye, in the raga Saramati, set to Adi tala, a composition of Dandapani Desikar.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Note: As we had mentioned before, we have not been able to find Cine songs for the ragas that we have handled in recent past. However, Mr. Hareesh came to our rescue and shared a link of raga based malayalam cine songs.&nbsp;Thanks Mr. Hareesh! We have enthusiatically attemped one song from that list for begada raga. Kindly bear with any pronunciation/diction errors&nbsp;<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy them all!<br/><br/>Week 42 Update:<br/><ul><li>New Ragas - Begada, Bahudhari, Mohanakalyani</li><li>Twin Raga - Bhairavi-Mukhari Comparison<br/></li><li>Surabhi Post - 7 - Swara Sthanas </li><li>Full song - Arulavendum Thaye</li><li>Weekly quiz - 42<br/></li></ul>Have a great week!<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Team<br/><br/>"

      "notes": "Dear Rasikas,We are happy to present to you this week's update, Raga Hamir Kalyani, a raga with a special sensual appeal. &nbsp;We have received numerous rasika requests asking us to take up this raga and its twin Saranga for comparison.&nbsp;Actually we are quite confident, that, by repeated listening of the signature patterns of both these ragas, rasikas themselves would be able to appreciate the difference between them. &nbsp;However, in order to honour their requests, we present to you a brief comparison of both these ragas.This week's quiz consists of three regular questions and two additional questions for identification of Saranga and Hamir Kalyani. &nbsp;So far, we have been asking only one question &nbsp;based on the raga presented in the 'Twin Raga Comparison' segment &nbsp;but we find rasikas (one of whom we know very well) arriving at the answer on the basis of mathematics (logic, probablility, permutation-combination) and not on the basis of the alapana rendered :) &nbsp;So, we have decided to have as many questions as the ragas discussed in the comparison episode. &nbsp;We hope you will also like the idea though it might consume a few more minutes of your precious time while answering the quiz:)The full song for this week is also a rasika request. We present a Utsava Sampradaya Kriti, Vadana dhyuthi jitha soma, by Saint Thyagaraja in the raga Pantuvarali, set to rupaka talam. Hope you like it.Week 36 update:<ul><li>New Raga - Hamir Kalyani</li><li>Compare Ragas - Saranga and Hamir Kalyani</li><li>Weekly Quiz - 36&nbsp;</li><li>Full song - Utsava Sampradaya Kriti</li></ul>Have a great week ahead!Raga Surabhi Team<br/><br/>"

We appeal to all rasikas to continue their participation in our raga quiz as usual.<br/><br/>These exercises are not a must for all, it is only for those enthusiasts who wrote to us about wanting to gain more knowledge in to the grammar of carnatic music.

A special thanks to each one of our rasikas for having joined us in this musical journey and for keeping us motivated with their appreciation, feedback and quiz answers.<br/><br/>We have the following special feature additions to website coinciding with this milestone.<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Logo - We are happy tell you that Raga Surabhi website now has its own logo. This has been made possible solely due to the creativity and imagination of Mr. K. Shafeek, colleague of Mr. G Ramasubramaniam,  who has put in his valuable time and effort to design this logo. We love the logo and hope you like it too. We express our sincere and heartfelt thanks to Shafeek. The logo contains seven rainbow colours symbolising sapthaswaras and the musical instruments are synonymous with carnatic music. Please feel free to download the logo artwork for your personal use.<br/><br/>Testimonials Page - We are delighted to put up this page to showcase some really nice feedback we have got through the weeks gone by. We thank our esteemed rasikas for agreeing to share their thoughts on this website.<br/><br/>New Email Address - We have finally configured our backend to receive email at ragasurabhi.com domain.

Please checkout snippets of those bhajans here: <a class=\"body_bulklinktext\" href=\"http://ragasurabhi.com/carnatic-music/buy-varnam-lessons.html\">Bhajans for Children Page with audio clips</a>.<br/>BTW, we also have a couple of combo basket offers in our <a  class=\"body_bulklinktext\" href=\"https://gumroad.com/ragasurabhi\">Raga Surabhi Gumroad store</a>!<br/><br/>Regarding the Special Quiz - Week 300 - AAA, we have received fairly a good response so far. Based on the survey feedback provided by our rasikas, we understand that this quiz happens to be a slightly tougher one than our previous quizzes.<br/><br/>Like all our earlier quizzes, this quiz was intended to make rasikas learn something new, take baby steps towards matching swaras with akaaram. But we realize that mapping akaaram to swaras has been quite challenging for many of our regular participants and this is something we wanted to address.<br/><br/>So, what do we do? The clue resides in, well......., giving clues!! :) So, those of y'all who were hesitant to tackle the quiz till now, you have got to get cracking! No excuses. Really! And, we have decided to <b>extend the quiz till 17th June!</b> So, get your thinking caps on, listen to the clues and answer away! The clues are right next to the questions. And, here's the <a class=\"body_bulklinktext\" href=\"http://ragasurabhi.com/carnatic-music/week-300-special-quiz.html\">Week 300 Special Quiz page</a><br/><br/>And all those who sent in their answers without the clues, not to worry! You guys deserve a special kudos. And, it'll be noted at results time. But, you can listen to the clues anyways and, either, sit back and bask in the glory of submitting the answers without any clues or just send in your revised answers. The choice is up to you. Sounds fair? Let us know.<br/><br/>And, we do eagerly await your Special Quiz answers! (Last date, again is 17th June, 2015, Wednesday)<br/><br/>Keep your regular quizzes answers coming!<br/><br/>Have a great week!<br/><br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Team.<br/><br/>"

With your support, we hope to continue this musical journey and hope to make our humble contribution to spreading Carnatic music among all.<br/><br/>We have a special quiz and a special song for this platinum week update.<br/><br/>The special quiz is different from the usual ones - there are no audio files. This is a theory quiz on Carnatic music. The answers can be anything related to Carnatic music - raga names, musicians, ... well, take the quiz to find out! You are free to use Google, Yahoo! or any other favorite search engine of yours to help you out! Do watch out for googlies :)  Good Luck and hope you have fun with the quiz!<br/><br/>The full song for this week is a compilation of the most common daily<br/>chant slokas.  We have chosen one sloka each on the following Gods -<br/>Vinayaka, Muruga, Shiva, Devi, Rama and Hanuman and tuned them in<br/>familiar ragas.  We hope you will enjoy listening to them. We will be happy if students learning carnatic music pick up the tune and sing them in their homes or in small functions.<br/><br/>We have not introduced new ragas for the past several weeks so that rasikas can assimilate the ragas covered so far. We now plan to take up new ragas slowly. Also, a note about raga comparisons - we would like to take up raga comparisons only after individual ragas is covered separately. For example, there have been several requests for Poorna Chandrika and Janaranjani; we will take this up once we cover Poorna Chandrika.<br/><br/>Just a couple of things about the special quiz:<br/>The deadline for the special quiz is 11-Feb-2011 (Friday midnight). Please submit your answers to quiz@ragasurabhi.com. Mention the subject as \"week 75 special quiz\".

It's a month of remembrance, of the sacrifices made by the leaders of Indian freedom struggle and by countless people who fought the British, and who made sacrifices so that we can enjoy the freedom and independence that we take for granted.<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi marks the occasion of Indian Independence Day with a series of special songs on this theme: 'August - The month of Independence'<br/><br/>The first in this series is titled 'Rang de Basanti', words associated with the great revolutionary Bhagat Singh.<br/><br/>The thoughtful words of this song are penned by Manish Kumar Gupta (Manish blogs at <a class=\"body_bulklinktext\"  href=\"http://manishkg.net/\" >http://manishkg.net/</a>)<br/>This song paints a realistic picture of nationalism by telling that since independence we have faced many big hurdles and are still adjusting/strugging, but our spirits continue to be high.<br/><br/>This song is set to tune by Uma in Raga Vasanti (Rag Basanti in Hindustani tradition).<br/><br/>The background musical score is by Balamurali Balu. A few words about Bala - Bala is a researcher at Intel, who turned a composer due to his burning passion for music. Bala is a very talented and promising musician who's worked in movies and jingles.<br/><br/>This is our first collaboration with Bala and we feel lucky that we could do this for this song. Despite his other engagements, he came up with this amazing score in just 30 minutes! We really think his score is fabulous and takes the musical gravitas of the song to altogether different level.<br/><br/>We highly recommend checking out Bala's Youtube channel:<br/><a class=\"body_bulklinktext\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLUeemFi8ZcanGhl05Y_ybg\" >https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLUeemFi8ZcanGhl05Y_ybg</a><br/>His 'Soaring Sarangi' is one of our favorites:<br/><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7u6hMlBa4XM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/>Looking forward to your feedback on this series and this song. Let the fragrance of Rang de Basanti spread far and wide. Do share with your friends!<br/><br/>As always, do participate in the weekly quiz.<br/><br/>Jai Hind!<br/><br/>Raga Surabhi Team.<br/><br/>"

The special song this week is our humble attempt to showcase India's diversity, rich culture and heritage in a very small way.  Hope you will love watching it, just as much as we enjoyed putting this together!\n<br><br>\nThis song is a compilation of patriotic lines of famous poets, taken from 10 different Indian languages and has been sung by four different artistes.  The highlight of the song is Vijay Kannan's wonderful arrangement that has made the blend of diverse melodies, rhythms and lyrics, so natural, seamless and refreshing.  Just as India's diversity, the song features 10 languages in 10 different ragas or scales and 5 different nadais or rhythmic patterns have been employed.\n<br><br>\nThe video contents of the song have been contributed by many friends and rasikas of Raga Surabhi and we are greatly thankful to them for all their interest, time and effort.  And to all the kids featured in the video......you guys just rocked it.....thank you and love you all so much :)\n<br><br>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r5UV6Y-xE14\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br><br>\nPlease do feel free to share the song as you send your Republic Day wishes to family and friends :)\n<br><br>\nJai Hind!\n<br><br>\nRaga Surabhi Team"

A musical journey of 627 weeks, filled with abundant joy and gratitude and made memorable through countless beautiful moments, cherished collaborations and invaluable comments and feedback from all of you.  Thank you rasikas for being there with us always, ever supporting and encouraging us in all our musical experiments! Special thanks to all my collaborators for joining me in this beautiful journey through their musical contributions. <br><br>Happy to launch this new series, Kshetra Yatra, as we step into this milestone.  This series would feature  compositions featuring important Kshetrams and temple towns of India.  First in this series is the most important Vaishnava Kshetra, Srirangam, which is known as 'Bhoo Loka Vaikuntam'.  Ranganai Kaana is an original composition in raga Surutti.  The music arrangement is by one of my dearest friends and collaborators, Balamurali Balu,  The groove, the base and the breathtaking flute interlude by Vijay Kannan matched brilliantly by the rhythm.........oh, I just loved it, hope you will also enjoy it as much!<br><br>It is an overwhelming moment for me that during the production of this video, I was able to shoot in and around Srirangam and Thiruvanaikaval, even though I had never anticipated it.  My dear friend and collaborator Mithun Shyam could also do the dance sequences in Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple in Chikabalapura near Bangalore.  Mithun's stunning choreography, the beautiful and sublime expressions of Kavya and Swetha, and tasteful editing by Harsha make this song an absolute treat to watch.  Don't miss that  breathtaking interlude sequence when the dancers just have a mind blowing performance. Special thanks to my friend Ashok Gunasekaran from Berlin for enhancing the final video at a very short notice.<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMLJu2RZr0w\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br><br>Please do also follow our Purvanga project to learn the purvanga of Brahma and Disi chakra.<br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SI0RqsJgyqE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mbsLgxfZ4h8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>The answers for the Special Quiz - 625 would be published next week, rasikas who might have missed submitting can take this opportunity to send in their answers.<br><br>Keep your quiz answers coming and have a great week ahead!<br><br>Uma Ram<br>Raga Surabhi"

An attempt to convey both shringaram and vatsalyam in the most beautiful Madhyamavati through this composition.  Really delighted to feature my student, Srimathi Varadarajan, whose marvellous painting has so aptly conveyed the essence of the song.  Special thanks to Srimathi's better half, Srinivasan Venkatraman for patiently capturing this beautiful piece of art for all of us to watch.  Hope you will enjoy watching this production.  Spread the joy by sharing it with family and friends!\r\n<br><br>\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGmiaqnRPxM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe results of Raga Riddles Special Quiz 650 will be published next week.
